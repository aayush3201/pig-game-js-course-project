This was the first app that I coded, both in the Javascript online course and otherwise. Like all my other projects so far, the HTML and CSS files of the app were provided by the course instructor. Even though, he gave a video tutorial on how to make the game, I decided to make it on my own using the logics that I could come up with. The game works perfectly even though my logic is different from the instructor.

Directions:-
Install and extract the project folder and simply open the HTML file with (preferably) Google Chrome.

How to play?

This game is to be played by two players.
Each of the players takes turns and roll the two dice.
The total of the number on the two dice is added to the current score of the current player.
The current score is added to the global score only once the player decides to hold.
Its the other players' turn once :
1. The current player holds in which case the current score is added to the global score.
2. The current player rolls a one on either die in which case the current score is lost.

In addition, in case a player rolls two sixes in a single roll, he/she not only loses the current score and his/her turn but also all of his/her global score!
The first to obtain a global score greater than or equal to a specified number (which can be typed in the input field below the buttons at any point in the game, else a default value is used) wins!
